Facebook backup doesn't include tagged photos, so here we are.

Well! It turns out that Facebook's [`/me/photos` endpoint](https://developers.facebook.com/support/bugs/2117724428555603/) does not include photos which aren't self-uploaded or public. So there is no way to retrieve photos you are tagged in by a friend aside from "manually" doing so.
